# Simple Penalty Shootout Game
This is a simple penalty shootout game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the user can choose a player (Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, or Mbappé) and then attempt to score a penalty. The game logic is as follows: every time the user clicks on the ball to shoot, a random number between 0 and 2 is generated for both the user and the CPU. If the numbers for the user and CPU are the same, it's a save; if they are different, it's a goal. (0 = left of the goal, 1 = center of the goal, 2 = right of the goal)

# How to Play
Choose a player by clicking on their image (Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, or Mbappé).
Click on the ball to shoot.
The game will randomize a number between 0-2 for both the user and CPU.
If the numbers are the same, it's a save; if they are different, it's a goal.
Keep playing to see how many goals you can score!
